1 - Mix 2 cups of water with 2 tablespoons of water. 
2 - Add more water to taste. 

3 - Empty the ice cubes that are left in the trays (if there are any left) into the bin.
4 - Take the trays over to the sink and fill them with cold water. (Hot water will freeze faster and more clear).
5 - Place the water filled ice trays back in the freezer.

"I wish there was a Crock-Pot version of this recipe. 
I work long hours and I just donÂ’t have the time to invest in this kind of hands-on cooking."
